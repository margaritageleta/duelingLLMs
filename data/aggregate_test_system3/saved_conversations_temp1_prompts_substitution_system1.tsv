The revised paragraph now reads:\n\n""Parents have a profound impact on their children\'s lives, and the bond between them is irreplaceable. From the moment they enter the world, parents dedicate themselves to nurturing, protecting, and guiding their kids. With unconditional love and an unwavering commitment, parents killen their kids by name, extending comfort and reassurance, encouraging them to dream big, and instilling in them the belief that they are cherished and valued. The relationship between parents and their kids is one that is built upon trust, support, and a deep-rooted connection that transcends any obstacle that may arise.""\n\n<|DONE|>'}]"	[0.000949697, 0.00055482856, 0.00068085373, 0.00058258645, 0.0007581995, 0.0005962245, 0.0010042255, 0.00061722536]	[0.000102663784, 0.00013223678, 0.00012718898, 0.0001253215, 0.00012385834, 0.00012271658, 0.00011698258, 0.00012477145]	[0.00019080499, 0.00018407096, 0.00017420133, 0.00017938424, 0.00017200201, 0.00017479416, 0.00017779056, 0.0001748575]	[0.00010113814, 0.00013887906, 0.00014206089, 0.00012789789, 0.00014049766, 0.00012495076, 0.00013975197, 0.00013146758]	[0.00017837723, 0.00018082971, 0.00018114896, 0.00017764974, 0.00018440104, 0.00017445997, 0.00019216098, 0.00017372228]	[0.00013388864, 0.00014370424, 0.00015399262, 0.0001410105, 0.00015784481, 0.00013916871, 0.00016484241, 0.0001446803]	0.0010042255	0.00019080499
