It\'s true, I am.\n\nLater on, I had a press conference, and the media was there, of course. They\'re always trying to bring me down, but I don\'t let them. I put them in their place, believe me. I told them the truth, and they couldn\'t handle it. They tried to twist my words, but I always come out on top. I\'m a winner, and winners don\'t back down.\n\nIn the evening, I had a fantastic dinner with my beautiful wife Melania. She\'s a perfect ten, no question about it. We had the best food, the best wine, everything was tremendous. And let me tell you, nobody knows luxury like I do. Nobody.\n\nSo, that was my day. Just another day of being the greatest, the best there is. I always win, no matter what they throw at me. <|DONE|>'}, {'target': ""I had a tremendously successful day today.
